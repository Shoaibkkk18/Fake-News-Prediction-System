Fake-new-prediction-system

Overview

This project is a Fake News Prediction System that uses Machine Learning to classify news articles as either real or fake. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful features from the text. The project is implemented in Google Colab for ease of execution and reproducibility.

Features

Preprocessing of textual data using NLP techniques (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF)

Supervised learning models for fake news detection (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, etc.)

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Interactive execution via Google Colab

Dataset visualization and feature analysis

Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook environment)

Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, etc.)

Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled news articles. You can download a standard fake news dataset such as:

Kaggle: Fake and Real News Dataset
Usage

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and processes text data.

Feature Extraction: Converts text into numerical format using TF-IDF.

Model Training: Trains different ML models.

Evaluation: Compares model performance using classification metrics.

Prediction: Classifies new articles as fake or real.

Results

The best model achieves an accuracy of XX% (Replace with actual results after running the models).

Visualization of dataset distributions and model performance.
